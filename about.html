            The name Michou stems from the owner's, Marie Noel, nickname Michou
            (Me-shoo). It was given to her by her family when she was young.
            Marie has always dreamed of creating a Haitian buisness and when she
            traveled to the United States, she often felt homesick and yearning
            for Haitian food. As she settled in the STL area with her children,
            she sought out the Haitian community and found out that there aren't
            many Haitian resturants in the area. So, she began to learn about
            the food industry and brainstorm ideas for her buisness with her
            only daughter, Imani. As Marie was retelling the story of she got
            the nickname Michou, Imani came up with the name Michou Cafe. Now
            Marie's dreams are slowly becoming a reality.

          <p class="about-pate">
            Marie used to walk home from school and stop by the market place.
            She would smell the pate in the stands and would rush home to beg
            her mom for money. When her mom did giv her money, she would walk to
            the pate stands and buy one. Walking back home, she would find
            herself wanting more pate. And each time she went back, they would
            all be sold out. As she moved to America, she found herself wanting
            to taste another pate, but many places did not make her want to go
            back for seconds. So with spices and Haitian flavor she recreated
            the Haitian pate that she's grew to love. Maybe you will find
            yourself coming back for more, but this time there will be enough
            for anyone.
